        <h2>Professor Oversight & Team Assembly</h2>
        <p>
            Professors can oversee all groups associated with their classes. They are able to create new teams, assign students to specific groups and roles, and monitor team membership throughout the course. Professors can add or remove students manually, view group progress, and ensure that team distributions align with course objectives and fairness guidelines.
